# Eco Me: Sustainable Cities and Communities

## Patrick Khoury | DH110 UX+UI | 2022 Fall

### DESIGN STATEMENT

Problem:
According to the United Nations, cities occupy just 3 percent of the Earth’s land, but account for 60-80 percent of energy consumption and 75 percent of carbon emissions. Inequality and the levels of urban energy consumption emissions are sprawling all suburbs all over the world.This has become such an issue that 9 in 10 people living in urban areas worldwide were breathing air that did not meet the World Health Organization’s air quality guidelines. By choosing to act sustainably, we choose to build cities where all citizens live a decent quality of life, and form a part of the city’s productive dynamic, creating shared prosperity and social stability without harming the environment. The cost of implementing sustainable practices in place is minimal in comparison with the benefits. For example, there is a cost to creating a functional public transport network, but the benefits are huge in terms of economic activity, quality of life, the environment, and the overall success of a networked city. All these issues facing sustainability will eventually affect every citizen. Inequality can lead to unrest and insecurity, pollution deteriorates everyone’s health and affects workers’ productivity and therefore the economy, and natural disasters have the potential to disrupt everyone’s lifestyles. 

Solution:
In my project, I hope to present a social-media-type app concept which incentivizes target users to be environmentally conscious, promotes activities and sustainable brands, allows for information to be presented to users, connects people who are existing or potential friends, and so much more. In the following assignment, I will evaluate the heuristics of two websites, one pertaining to my project subject and one not, based on Jakob Nielson’s 10 general principles for interaction design.
